Healthcare systems generate vast amounts of data that can be leveraged to improve patient outcomes through AI-driven insights. However, the lack of standardized vocabularies for representing health trajectories, disease progression, and AI model performance creates challenges in data interoperability and model evaluation. 

COPE addresses these challenges by providing a comprehensive ontology that captures the complex relationships between patient characteristics, health trajectories, disease progression patterns, risk factors, symptoms, and AI models. The ontology supports the modeling of cycle of deconditioning patterns, enables the evaluation of AI models through performance metrics, and facilitates the integration of diverse healthcare data sources for improved clinical decision-making and research applications.

The ontology is designed to support healthcare AI research by providing a standardized vocabulary for representing patient health journeys, disease progression patterns, and the AI models that analyze them. This enables better interoperability between different healthcare systems and AI applications.</span>

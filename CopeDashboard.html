        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
          Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are
          increasingly being leveraged in healthcare to support the early
          detection, prediction, and personalized management of chronic
          diseases. Yet, their effective application remains limited by the
          absence of structured frameworks that unify diverse patient data,
          evolving disease trajectories, and computational methodologies. In
          this work, we present a comprehensive ontology designed to support
          health informaticians and data scientists in navigating this complex
          landscape. The ontology formalizes critical components of chronic
          disease modeling, including biological, behavioral, demographic, and
          geographical patient characteristics, modifiable and non-modifiable
          risk factors, symptom evolution, disease outcomes, and cycles of
          deconditioning. In parallel, it incorporates representations of AI/ML
          concepts such as modelling techniques, data modalities, sources, and
          problem formulation strategies. Crucially, the ontology embeds a
          temporal framework, allowing for the representation of timestamped
          observations and interventions supporting trajectory modelling from
          real-time and longitudinal data. It also models the provenance and
          context of AI/ML models, linking them to datasets, research
          publications, and domain-specific concepts. By providing a semantic
          foundation that bridges clinical knowledge and AI capabilities, this
          ontology enables the identification of data and methodological gaps,
          supports interpretability, and fosters the development of patient
          focused, data driven solutions. We demonstrate its utility through
          exemplar queries and use cases, offering it as a reusable resource for
          advancing the integration of AI in chronic disease care.

      <div id="introduction">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Chronic diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular conditions, and
          respiratory illnesses represent a significant burden on global
          healthcare systems, accounting for nearly 74% of all deaths worldwide
          [1]. Early detection and effective intervention are critical to
          managing these conditions and improving patient outcomes. In recent
          years, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) have
          emerged as powerful tools in this space, enabling prediction,
          stratification, and personalized care planning [2, 3]. However,
          despite the availability of increasingly rich datasets from sources
          such as Electronic Health Records (EHRs), wearable devices, and
          clinical imaging, the practical integration of AI/ML into chronic
          disease management remains a challenge.
        </p>
        <p>
          A key barrier lies in the lack of semantic frameworks that formally
          connect patient characteristics, disease trajectories, risk factors,
          and computational methods. Health informaticians often struggle to
          navigate a fragmented landscape of data types, algorithms, and domain
          knowledge when designing or interpreting AI driven health systems.
          Ontologies, a formal and structured representation of knowl- edge [4],
          offer a promising solution by capturing the complex interdependencies
          among data, models in a machine interpretable way [5]. While several
          biomedical ontologies exist, such as Systematized Nomenclature of
          Medicine: Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT) [6], International Classification
          of Diseases (ICD) [7], and Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources
          (FHIR) [8], they often lack support for repre- senting technical AI/ML
          dimensions such as modelling approaches, explainability mechanisms, or
          the evolving nature of wearable derived data [6].
        </p>
        <p>
          To address this gap, we propose an ontology that provides a unified
          representation of patient centered disease modelling and AI/ML
          integration. This ontology is designed to support health
          informaticians and data scientists in selecting appropriate modelling
          techniques, identifying relevant data sources, and understanding the
          implications of patient specific attributes on prediction outcomes. It
          captures key elements such as biological, behavioral, psychographic,
          demographic, and geographical characteristics of patients, disease
          risk factors (including their modifiability), symptom profiles, and
          outcomes. Impor- tantly, it also includes classes and properties for
          AI/ML techniques (such as classification, regression, clustering),
          data nature (such as structured, time series), data sources (such as
          ECG, EHRs), and research outputs (such as datasets, papers, venues).
        </p>
        <p>
          Crucially, the ontology introduces a temporal framework by modelling
          timestamped clinical observa- tions. Through the ObservationEvent
          class, it records the temporal context of symptoms, interventions, and
          risk exposure, enabling the representation of dynamic disease
          trajectories. This supports complex temporal queries such as: What
          symptoms manifested following a particular intervention? or How did a
          patient’s risk profile evolve across disease stages?
        </p>
        <p>
          The ontology also supports traceable and interpretable AI by embedding
          the provenance of compu- tational models including their training
          datasets, algorithmic strategies, and contextual usage within the same
          semantic space as clinical knowledge. AI models are connected to the
          specific data they consume, the techniques they employ, and the
          literature that supports their use, thereby aligning with the
          principles of transparency, reproducibility, and explainability in
          healthcare AI [9].
        </p>
        <p>
          The proposed ontology aims to serve three purposes: (1) to support
          trajectory modelling of chronic diseases using continuous or episodic
          data from wearable devices, (2) to enable health informaticians and
          data scientists to systematically explore how data science can
          contribute to chronic disease prediction and management, and (3) to
          guide the development and evaluation of AI/ML methods that are
          interpretable, patient focused, and clinically actionable. We
          demonstrate the applicability of the ontology through a set of
          competency questions, use case examples, and exemplar queries.

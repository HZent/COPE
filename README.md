# Welcome to COPE!

The Chronic Observation and Progression Events (COPE) Ontology is a structured, semantic framework designed to represent and reason about long-term health data with a focus on chronic disease progression. COPE offers a machine-actionable way to capture the nuanced, context-rich characteristics of individuals ranging from biological and behavioral traits to environmental and psychographic factors, alongside key events such as symptoms, risk factors, interventions, and disease outcomes.

Developed as an evolving and extensible ontology, COPE supports the integration of diverse health-related data sources to facilitate research, AI-based analysis, and clinical decision-making. A future direction of COPE is to be used to model digital twins of individuals for the simulation and monitoring of health trajectories, enabling proactive and personalized healthcare approaches. COPE also includes support for describing datasets, AI models, and scholarly outputs, enabling its application not only in health analytics but also in reproducible research and knowledge sharing.

We invite researchers, developers, and clinicians to explore the ontology, contribute to its development, and apply it in advancing chronic disease modelling and person-centred care.

To ensure best practices in ontology publication, COPE is assigned the persistent namespace https://purl.archive.org/cope#, which is dereferenceable and ensures long-term accessibility.
